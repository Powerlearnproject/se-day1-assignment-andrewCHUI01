Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is a systematic application of engineering principles,methods to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.


1.Builds reliable systems-Ensures software works correctly and efficiently.

2.Scalability-Helps business grow by creating software that handles users data

3.Drives innovation-Powers AI,web apps,mobile apps.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.Birth of programming-Development of high-level languages like FORTRAN and COBOL in the 1950s made coding easier.

2.Structured programming-eg C and software development methodologies introduction in the 1970s and 80s helped reduced errors.

3.Agile and modern software development-Shift from methodslike waterfall to Agile made software faster.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Planning-Defining project goals.

2.Requirement Analysis- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

3.Design-System architecture and technical specifications.

4.Implementation-Actual coding or building.

5.Testing-checking any bugs and if the quality and requirements are met.

6.Deployment-Releasing the software for users.

7.Maintenance-Updating and improving features over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

WATERFALL                          AGILE
1.Sequential                       1.Iterative flexible

2.changes hard to make             2.Adaptable allows changes

3.Testing is after development     3.Testing is done continous

Waterfall used where requirements are fixed eg a banking system.Agile used where features evolve based on user eg mobile app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER-Writes, tests, and maintains code.

QUALITY ASSUARANCE-Ensures the software meets quality standards.Creates and run test to find bugs.

PROJECT MANAGER-Oversees the entire project from start to finish.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDES eg  Visual Studio Code (VS Code) this is the coding station.

Boosts productivity with auto-completion and debugging also managing large files effectively.

(VCS) EG GIT(GITHUB GITLAB) Helps to prevent loss of code and helps in collaboration and team work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Keeping Up with Changing Technology-Overcoming by constart reading and personal project
    
2. Debugging andfixing bugs-use Vs code and following a structured.
 
3. Dealing with Legacy Code and Technical Debt- Use automated tests to ensure changes don’t break existing functionality and following code best practices.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components.
   
2. Integration Testing – Tests how different modules or services work together.
 
3. System Testing  – Tests the entire software as a whole
 
4. Acceptance Testing  – Validates if the software meets user requirements






#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of designing inputs  to get accurate, relevant, and useful responses from AI models.

It helps to get better AI responses and better productivity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about earth.

Tell me about the inner cores of earth and its characteristics.

The improved version is way spesific giving you a better understanding unlike the first one which is general which will give you generak superficial answers.
